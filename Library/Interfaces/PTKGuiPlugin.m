classdef PTKGuiPlugin < handle
    % PTKGuiPlugin. Base class for a Gui-level plugin used by the Pulmonary Toolkit.
    %
    %     Gui Plugins are classes you create to run gui-related routines from
    %     the Pulmonary Toolkit user interface. Like plugins, gui plugins each
    %     have a button on the user interface. Unlike plugins, gui plugins do
    %     not generate results and cannot be called from outside of the gui.
    %     They are intended for operations related to the gui application such
    %     as importing and exporting of data, and visualising data such as 3D
    %     images and movies.
    %
    %     Gui Plugins must reside in the GuiPlugins folder, and
    %     inherit from this class, PTKGuiPlugin. Provided that the properties have
    %     been correctly set, the plugin will automatically appear in the
    %     Pulmonary Toolkit gui.
    %
    %     Gui plugins are given a handle to the PTKGuiApp object so they can
    %     access gui methods and obtain dataset results if necessary
