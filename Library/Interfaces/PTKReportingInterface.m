classdef PTKReportingInterface < PTKBaseClass
    % PTKReportingInterface. Provides an interface for error and progress reporting.
    %
    %     PTKReportingInterface is the interface the Pulmonary Toolkit uses to
    %     process errors, warnings, messages, logging information and progress
    %     reports. It is also used as a callback to the GUI (if it exists) for
    %     plugins to get the current orientation and marker image.
    %
    %     You can create your own implementation of this interface to get
    %     customised message behaviour; for example, if you are running a batch
    %     script you may wish to write all messages to a log file instead of
    %     displaying them on the command line.
    %
    %     This is an abstract class; you should not directly create an instance
    %     of PTKReportingInterface. Instead, you should either use one of the
    %     existing implementation classes (PTKReporting, PTKReportingDefault) or
    %     you can create your own to achieve customised behaviour.
