classdef PTKProgressInterface < PTKBaseClass
    % PTKProgressInterface. Interface for classes which implement a progress bar.
    %
    %     The PTKReporting class uses this interface to display and update a
    %     progress bar and associated text. The PTKProgressDialog class
    %     implements the progress bar as a standard Matlab progress dialog,
    %     whereas the PTKReportingPanel implements a custom progress panel for an
    %     existing figure.
    %
    %     You can implement custom progress reporting by creating a class which
    %     implements this interface, and then passing an instance of your
    %     progress class into PTKReporting.
