classdef PTKVirtualPanel < PTKUserInterfaceObject
    % PTKVirtualPanel.  Part of the gui for the Pulmonary Toolkit.
    %
    %     This class is used to help build the user interface.
    %
    %     PTKVirtualPanel represents a PTK panel which does not have an underlying
    %     Matlab panel component. In other words, the VirtualPanel acts like a real
    %     panel to PTK, but any Matlab components which act on it are actually
    %     acting on the parent panel handle.
    %
    %     The purpose of a PTKVirtualPanel is to simplify user interface design by
    %     allowing the separation of a panel into smaller panels without introducing
    %     the overhead of creating additional graphical objects.
